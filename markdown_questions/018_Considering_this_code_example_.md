Considering this code example:


[code]function WarningButton() {
Â  return <CustomButton color="red" />;
}[/code]

Which of the following statements are true?

#
[b]CustomButton [/b]is a React component

#
[b]WarningButton [/b]is a React component


There is an error in the JSX syntax of that function


[b]color [/b]is a prop of [b]WarningButton[/b]
