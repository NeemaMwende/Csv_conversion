Considering the following code example, which affirmations are correct?


[code]const [count, setCount] = useState(0);[/code]

#
This is an example of React Hook

#
[b]setCount [/b]is a setter for the [b]count [/b]variable


[b]count [/b]has no default value


This code can only be found in a class component.
