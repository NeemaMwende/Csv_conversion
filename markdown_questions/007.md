Is there anything wrong with the following JSX syntax?


[code]<button onClick={extendDate()} disabled={selection.isEmpty()}>
    Extend date for selection
</button>[/code]

# Correct

Yes, the [b]onClick [/b]event listener is not going to work properly.

#

No, the code looks correct.

#

Yes, the click listener syntax should be[b] (onClick)[/b].

#

Yes, some curly braces [b]{ }[/b] are missing.
